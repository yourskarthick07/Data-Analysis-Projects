ðŸ“Š Iris Dashboard

The Iris Dashboard is an interactive visualization project built using the classic Iris dataset, one of the most well-known datasets in machine learning and data analysis.

This dashboard provides a comprehensive view of the dataset by exploring sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width across the three Iris species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica). Through clear and engaging visuals, users can easily identify patterns, compare distributions, and analyze relationships between features.

ðŸ”¹ Key Highlights

Feature-wise breakdown (sepal & petal measurements)

Species-level comparison with interactive filtering

Distribution charts for exploring variation in data

Intuitive design for better understanding of classification patterns

The dashboard is designed not only as a data exploration tool, but also as a beginner-friendly example for applying data visualization techniques on a structured dataset.
